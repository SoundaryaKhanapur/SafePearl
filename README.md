# SafePearl 💗✨

## 🚀 Inspiration
Harassment is a deeply pervasive issue that leaves victims feeling helpless, unheard, and afraid to seek support. Many people hesitate to speak up due to fear, stigma, or not knowing where to turn for help. In a world where survivors often feel isolated, **SafePearl** provides a **private, anonymous, and judgment-free space** where they can share their experiences, receive empathetic AI-generated guidance, and find real-world support, all while ensuring complete privacy.  

## 💡 What It Does
- **🕵️ Anonymous Experience Sharing:** Users can either type or record their experience without fear of judgment. The **recording option** is included because many victims find it easier to **speak rather than type** when recalling traumatic events.  
- **🤖 AI-Powered Support:** OpenAI provides **empathetic, structured, and actionable guidance** in four key areas: acknowledgment, encouragement, coping strategies, and next steps. Unlike generic AI tools, SafePearl is specifically tuned to **help victims understand what happened to them, assure them they are not to blame, and encourage them to speak up rather than remain silent.**  
- **📍 Real-Time Resource Finder:** SafePearl detects the user's location (with permission) and displays **nearby harassment support centers** using Google Maps API, ensuring users can take real-world action beyond digital advice.  
- **🗺️ Interactive Map:** Users can view support organizations pinned on a map for easy access, eliminating the hassle of searching for help themselves.  
- **🔒 Privacy-First Approach:** No data is stored, ensuring a completely **safe and secure** experience for users who may fear retaliation or exposure.
